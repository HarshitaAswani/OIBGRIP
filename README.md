# OASIS INFOBYTE INTERNSHIP
This internship was all about data science and analytics. I applied for this internship from the website of Oasis Infobyte. I completed 4 tasks out of 5 tasks. The description of all the tasks is given below:

### Task-1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

I predicted the species of IRIS Flower using the attributes given such as: petal length, sepal length, petal width and sepal width. I used K NEAREST NEIGHBORS classifier for classification of species.

### Task-2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS

I explored the dataset by creating various charts and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn libraries of python.

### Task-4: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION

I created a support vector machine classifier for detecting messages as spam or non-spam. I also calculated the accuracy of the model to check its efficiency. The accuracy score was 0.977.

### Task-5: SALES PREDICTION 

I used linear regression model for forecasting the sales.
